# Milestone Audit: v1.3 - Ecosystem Expansion & UI Launch

**Audited:** 2026-02-14

## Summary
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Phases | 6 (12-17) |
| Gap closures | 1 (Phase 17) |
| Technical debt items | 4 |

Milestone 1.3 successfully transitioned the platform from a backend-centric service to a multi-portal ecosystem. The core achievements included identity resolution across toolchains, production-ready frontend orchestration, and a strictly typed telemetry bus.

## Must-Haves Status
| Requirement | Verified | Evidence |
|-------------|----------|----------|
| GitHub Author Resolution | ✅ | [VERIFICATION.md](file:///Users/ekesel/Desktop/projects/DMT-SLDP/.gsd/phases/13/VERIFICATION.md) |
| Next.js Portal Deployment | ✅ | [VERIFICATION.md](file:///Users/ekesel/Desktop/projects/DMT-SLDP/.gsd/phases/16/VERIFICATION.md) |
| Typed Telemetry | ✅ | [VERIFICATION.md](file:///Users/ekesel/Desktop/projects/DMT-SLDP/.gsd/phases/12/VERIFICATION.md) |
| Resilient Docker Scaling | ✅ | [VERIFICATION.md](file:///Users/ekesel/Desktop/projects/DMT-SLDP/.gsd/phases/16/VERIFICATION.md) |

## Quality Analysis
The milestone execution was robust, with major blockers (Next.js security vulnerabilities) handled proactively. However, the preliminary audit (Phase 16) revealed three operational gaps:
1.  **Orchestration Fragility**: Volume mappings in Docker were too restrictive, breaking monorepo workspace resolution.
2.  **Log Aging**: `TODO.md` was significantly out of sync with current project status.
3.  **Environment Drift**: Node 18 was insufficient for Next.js 16 requirements.

These were fully resolved in **Phase 17 (Gap Closure)**, resulting in a hardened production configuration.

## Recommendations
1.  **Shift Left for Security**: Automate `npm audit` in CI/CD earlier to avoid late-stage major version bumps (like the Next.js 16 jump).
2.  **Session Transition**: Move away from simple JWT/Localstorage towards secure session-based auth in Milestone 1.4.
3.  **Component Library Maturity**: Transition `@dmt/ui` from mock/placeholders to dynamic components once Backend APIs stabilize.

## Technical Debt to Address
- [ ] Implement robust token rotation for GitHub/Jira connectors.
- [ ] Upgrade session management to secure httpOnly cookies.
- [ ] Optimize Docker build times (currently rebuilding entire monorepo).
- [ ] Replace Velocity Chart placeholders with live Recharts integration (v1.4 goal).
