## Concerns
- **Vertex AI SDK Deprecation**: Logs indicate that certain features used for AI insights will be removed by June 24, 2026.
- **Port Orchestration**: Encountered port 8000 conflicts during verification; suggests a need for more robust dev container orchestration.
- **Task Discovery**: Celery autodiscovery required explicit package registration for `data.ai`, posing a risk for future submodule drift.

## Recommendations
1. **Update Vertex AI SDK**: Transition to non-deprecated APIs for insight generation.
2. **Implement Typed Telemetry**: Pursue backlog item to migrate internal messaging to strictly typed models.
3. **Frontend Refinement**: Complete the Next.js migration for the Admin and Company portals.

- [x] CI/CD Signal Extraction (Completed in Phase 8)
- [x] Asynchronous AI Processing (Completed in Phase 7)
- [ ] Typed Telemetry
- [ ] GitHub Author Resolution
- [ ] Configure Docker environment (Scaling)
- [ ] Setup Next.js frontend projects
