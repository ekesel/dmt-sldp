# Milestone Audit: v1.0 MVP

**Audited:** 2026-02-13

## Summary
The v1.0 MVP milestone for the DMT-SLDP platform is structurally complete and functional. All five phases have been executed and verified against the specification. The platform successfully supports multi-tenant isolation, ETL for three source types (Jira, ClickUp, Azure Boards), a quality enforcement engine (DMT), and an AI-powered analytics dashboard.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Phases Completed | 5 / 5 |
| Must-Haves Verified | 17 / 17 |
| Source Types Supported | 3 (Jira, ClickUp, Azure Boards) |
| Gap closures during execution | 0 (Clean execution) |
| Technical debt items identified | 4 |

## Concerns
- **Mock AI Service**: The `AIService` currently uses a mock implementation. While the infrastructure (prompts, tasks, models) is solid, real LLM integration is required for actual value.
- **WebSocket Maturity**: The real-time stream endpoint is a placeholder. Multi-tenant live telemetry needs a robust implementation in `backend/data/consumers.py` (not yet fully fleshed out).
- **Hardcoded WebSocket URL**: The frontend hook hardcodes the WebSocket URL, which should be moved to env variables for production.
- **Security Hardening**: Structure is JWT-based, but production-grade security (CSRF, Secure Cookies, HSTS) hasn't been audited.

## Recommendations
1. **Promote AI Service**: Replace the mock implementation in `backend/data/ai/service.py` with real Gemini or Vertex AI integration.
2. **Implement Telemetry Stream**: Flesh out the Django Channels consumers to stream real sync and compliance events to the Company Portal.
3. **Frontend Configuration**: Move hardcoded values (API endpoints, WebSocket URLs) into `.env.local` for the Next.js portals.
4. **End-to-End Integration Testing**: While each component works, a full cross-tenant sync regression test suite should be established.

## Technical Debt to Address
- [ ] Implement real LLM client in `AIService`.
- [ ] Develop real-time WebSocket consumers for multi-tenant metrics.
- [ ] Security hardening (CORS, CSRF, Secure Cookies).
- [ ] Centralize TODOs and Decisions into dedicated files.
