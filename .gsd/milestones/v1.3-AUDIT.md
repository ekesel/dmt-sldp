## Concerns
- **Security**: Current portal authentication relies on JWT but lacks robust session-based handling and secure cookie flows (Must address in v1.4).
- **Test Coverage**: While functional verification is high, automated unit/integration test coverage for the Compliance Engine is still lagging.
- **Data Latency**: Real-time updates via WebSockets are functional, but high-frequency updates might cause performance degradation under load (Monitor during AI rollout).

## Recommendations
1. **Hardened Auth**: Prioritize transitioning to secure session-based authentication in Phase 19.
2. **Compliance Testing**: Implement a dedicated test suite for `ComplianceEngine` edge cases (e.g., partial data, inconsistent PM states).
3. **CI/CD Integration**: Move beyond manual Docker orchestration to a streamlined CI/CD pipeline.

## Technical Debt to Address
- [ ] Implement robust token rotation for connectors.
- [ ] Secure session-based auth for portals.
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline optimization.
- [ ] Extended test coverage for Compliance Engine.
