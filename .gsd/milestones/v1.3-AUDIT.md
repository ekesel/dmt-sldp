| Phases completed | 5 (12-16) |
| Gap closures | 1 (Phase 16 vulnerability fix) |
| Technical debt items | 1 (Outdated TODO.md) |

## Must-Haves Status
| Requirement | Verified | Evidence |
|-------------|----------|----------|
| GitHub Author Resolution | ✅ | [.gsd/phases/13/VERIFICATION.md](file:///Users/ekesel/Desktop/projects/DMT-SLDP/.gsd/phases/13/VERIFICATION.md) |
| Next.js Portal Deployment | ✅ | [.gsd/phases/15/VERIFICATION.md](file:///Users/ekesel/Desktop/projects/DMT-SLDP/.gsd/phases/15/VERIFICATION.md) |
| Typed Telemetry (Pydantic) | ✅ | [.gsd/phases/12/VERIFICATION.md](file:///Users/ekesel/Desktop/projects/DMT-SLDP/.gsd/phases/12/VERIFICATION.md) |
| Resilient Docker Scaling | ✅ | [.gsd/phases/16/VERIFICATION.md](file:///Users/ekesel/Desktop/projects/DMT-SLDP/.gsd/phases/16/VERIFICATION.md) |

## Concerns
- **Outdated Project Logs**: `TODO.md` still lists Phase 1 foundation tasks as uncompleted. This risks confusion for future phases.
- **Dependency Aggression**: The forced update to `next@16.1.6` was necessary for security but represents a significant version jump from the initial `14.2.x` baseline.

## Recommendations
1. **Sanitize `TODO.md`**: Refresh the global TODO list to remove completed foundation items and prioritize Milestone 1.4 features.
2. **Regression Testing**: Conduct a focused smoke test of the dashboards using the new Next.js 16 runtime to ensure glassmorphism styles and Recharts remain stable.

## Technical Debt to Address
- [ ] Implement robust token rotation for GitHub/Jira connectors (deferred to later milestones).
- [ ] Refine `localStorage` based tenant switching in `@dmt/api` to a more secure session-based or cookie-based approach.
