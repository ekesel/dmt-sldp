## Analysis of Phase Quality
The milestone was executed with high discipline. No gap closure plans were required, and all 5 phases passed verification on the first attempt after implementation. The multi-tenant isolation and security hardening were prioritized early, providing a stable foundation for the AI and GitHub layers.

## Concerns
- **AI Reliability**: The current Vertex AI integration has a basic fallback but lacks circuit breakers or exponential backoff for rate limiting.
- **Compliance Rules**: The compliance logic is currently "simplified" to PR presence; it needs to account for CI/CD status and PR approval state in v1.2.

## Recommendations
1. **Harden Compliance Engine**: Extend the engine to check for merged status and successful build signals.
2. **AI Resilience**: Implement a more robust error-handling layer for LLM calls.

## Technical Debt to Address
- [ ] Refactor `ComplianceEngine` rules into a configurable policy engine.
- [ ] Implement robust retry logic and circuit breakers for `GeminiAIProvider`.
- [ ] Standardize author resolution in `GitHubConnector` for non-public emails.
- [ ] Formalize WebSocket message schemas into TypedDicts or Data Classes.
