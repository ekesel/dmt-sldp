## Concerns
- **CI/CD Signal Logic**: Compliance currently relies only on PR merge status. Real CI/CD signals (Build/Test results) are mocked/placeholders.
- **AI Latency**: Gemini integration is working but relies on synchronous processing in tasks. Large tenants may see latency.

## Recommendations
1. **Asynchronous AI Processing**: Move AI insight generation to a dedicated event-driven queue with failure persistence beyond simple retries.
2. **Schema-level Auditing**: Implement generic PostgreSQL audit triggers to track compliance status changes history.

## Technical Debt to Address
- [ ] **Typed Telemetry**: Migrate internal message bus to strictly typed models (Pydantic/DataClasses) to avoid broadcast errors.
- [ ] **GitHub Author Resolution**: Map GitHub usernames to internal `DMT-User` identities for better attribution.
- [ ] **Jira OAuth Flow**: Research and implement OAuth2 for Jira (currently using basic/mocked auth).
- [ ] **CI/CD Signal Extraction**: Extend GitHub connector to fetch `CheckSuites` and `Status` signals for compliance verification.
