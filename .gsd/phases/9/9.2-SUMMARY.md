# Plan 9.2 Summary: Jira OAuth2 Implementation

## Tasks Accomplished
- [x] Refactored `JiraConnector` to use OAuth2 Bearer tokens in headers.
- [x] Implemented `refresh_access_token` method with automatic retry on 401 Unauthorized.
- [x] Updated `sync_tenant_data` task to proactively refresh tokens before sync waves.
- [x] Empirically verified the refresh flow and credential persistence via `verify_phase_9` management command.

## Verification Results
- 401 handling: Verified that an expired token triggers a successful refresh and retry.
- Persistence: Verified that the new `access_token` and `refresh_token` are saved back to the `Integration.credentials` field.
- Data Integrity: Verified that Jira work items are fetched correctly after a successful refresh.
