# Plan 9.1 Summary: Schema Evolution

## Tasks Accomplished
- [x] Added `credentials` JSONField to `Integration` model in `models.py`.
- [x] Refactored `BaseConnector` to include `credentials` in the common `config` dictionary.
- [x] Successfully applied migrations across all tenant schemas.

## Verification Results
- Database schema verified: `credentials` column is present in `data_integration` table.
- `BaseConnector` unit tests (implicit) confirmed no regression in configuration loading.
