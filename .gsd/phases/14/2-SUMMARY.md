# Summary: Plan 14.2 - Portal Scaffolding & Design Integration

## Accomplishments
- Scaffolded **Admin Portal** (`apps/admin`) with a dedicated "Platform Administration" landing page.
- Scaffolded **Company Portal** (`apps/app`) with a KPI-focused "Company Dashboard" landing page.
- Integrated shared `@dmt/ui` components (Card, Button) into both portals.
- Configured **Tailwind CSS** in each app to consume the shared design system.
- Established consistent layout, typography (Inter), and core styling (Glassmorphism).

## Verification
- Both portals render correctly with the unified aesthetic.
- Lucide React icons are used consistently for navigation and status.
- Next.js 14 App Router used for all new routing.
